## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anan328/TypeScript-Project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd TypeScript-Project
   ```

3. **Install TypeScript globally (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

4. **Compile the TypeScript file:**
   Use the following command to compile `sandbox.ts`:
   ```bash
   tsc sandbox.ts
   ```

   If you want the compiled JavaScript file to have a different name, specify it explicitly:
   ```bash
   tsc sandbox.ts --outFile customName.js
   ```

5. **Open `index.html` in Live Server:**
   Ensure the `style.css` file is loaded for proper styling.

## File Structure

- `sandbox.ts`: Contains the core TypeScript logic.
- `sandbox.js`: The compiled JavaScript file generated from `sandbox.ts`.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project.
- `style.css`: Adds styling to the project.
